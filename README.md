# ENVY :: Expandable New View for Yadoms

## Installation

First you need `nodejs`

To generate the previews, I recommend the `yarn` tool, instead of `npm`.

```
npm install -g yarn
```

After installing `yarn`, you have to install all devDependencies present in `package.json`.

```
yarn install
```
